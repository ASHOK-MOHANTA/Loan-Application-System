## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Authentication & Role Assignment**  
   - Users, Managers, and Admins have different dashboard views and access permissions.
   - Managers must be approved by Admin before gaining full access.

2. **Multi-Step Loan Application Form**  
   - Saves form data step-by-step and validates inputs before proceeding.
   - Final submission stores data in Firebase Firestore.

3. **Manager Application Review**  
   - Pending loan applications are displayed to managers for approval/rejection.

4. **Admin Approval System**  
   - Admin verifies and approves manager accounts.
   - Admin has access to all submitted loan applications.
